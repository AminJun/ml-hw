## Answering Questions about Science

To make sure that folks have a good project to work on, I make sure to provide a project (with data) that folks can work on even if they are not inspired with a great project idea.

This is a project that I care about.  One project that I work on is to help computers answer questions.  

As you can see from the video, our system does not answer science questions very well.  That's where I need your help.

## AI2 Science Challenge

This is improtant for me, but other folks are working on similar challenges.  There's a big Kaggle challenge trying to answer science questions.  We'll use the same data format that they're using.

## How our Data are Different

Unlike the AI2 challenge, all of our questions will have answers that are entities (i.e., things that have Wikipedia pages).  I suspect that this will make it quite a bit easier.  So you may want to try to do our challenge first; but if your method generalizes to both, then that's great!

I've set up a Kaggle site in the same spirit as the Kaggle challenge.

We may be able to add additional data

## What happens if I do well?

You get a good grade, my thanks, and your ideas will be integrated into the next version of our system.

## FAQ

*Do I have to do both challenges?*

No, you can choose to focus on one or othe other.  

*Do you have any clues/code?*

You can take a look at our code; it might give you ideas.  However, it doesn't do anything science specific, which will likely be helpful.
